About me
------------

I am currently working as the Technical lead of Data science and analytics at [Cloudphysician Healthcare](https://cloudphysician.net/). 
I did my MD in Internal Medicine in Rutgers Health, NJ and one year of research in Pulmonary and Critical 
care medicine at Johns Hopkins University before returning to India to join Cloudphysician.

I started my research stint in the field of sleep and metabolism while at Hopkins and have authored one of the most cited 
papers on Inflammation in sleep apnea. Since joining my current organization, I have been focusing on 
leveraging data in tacking the inefficiencies in healthcare ecosystem thereby empowering both the patients and
providers.

I currently lead a team of developers, analysts and ML engineers to add smart features to the healthcare delivery
platform of the company called Radar. The teams current efforts are focused on 
* Improving healthcare provider workflow efficiency
* Providing clinical and operational insights to the providers/managers
* Creating large community/state/national level repositories of healthcare data

Additionally team works closely with the clinical research team in the company headed by [Dr. Carl Britto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-britto-77399650/) 
and researchers like [Dr. Subodha Kumar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subodha_Kumar) to publish various clinical and 
operational research papers.

Team Projects
------------
1. Developed a smart note taking tool for healthcare providers that generates admission and progress notes in natural 
language by parsing the patient's health records. This tool is currently being using by hundreds of healthcare providers in their 
daily workflow and has demonstrably improved their efficiency. 
2. Created a database similar to [MIMIC III](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii-demo/1.4/) database that currently harbors high quality 
data of over 35,000 ICU admissions. This is the largest dataset of its kind in the country and provide periodic clinical and operational 
insights to over fourty partner ICUs through dashboards.
3. Currently developing model to predict clinical deterioration hours in advance among patients in the ICU using various monitored clinical 
parameters. The idea for this has been granted a patent by Govt. of India.
